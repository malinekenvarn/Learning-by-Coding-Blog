This is a basic blog backend that I built with Node.js. My main focus was to build something that can post, get, and delete from a database because I want to learn to use JavaScript for backend projects. I used Express to build this application and Mongodb for my database.
This is not a web design project, but I added some CSS and used my favorite google font Inconsolata.

I have a lot of comments in the code and it can look messy, but I have them there because this code is to help me learn concepts and I like to explain everything going on here in every step.
