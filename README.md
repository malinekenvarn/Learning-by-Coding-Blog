This is a project that I do to learn MongoDB, Express, and Node.

I choose to make a blog because I like blogging but I haven't yet found a blogging platform for myself yet. So instead of learning about Wordpress or Medium, I build my own blog for now.

My main focus right now is to understand the backend, so I don't have so much design yet. I use EJS for the view engine, and style with some very basic CSS. I have not yet developed my graphic preferences, bur for now I use Inconsolata for my fonts and simple black and white colors.
